# neural_image
An example of fitting a [neural image](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) to pixel values written in [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html). 
The image is a Sagitarrius A* model from [eht-imaging](https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging/tree/main/models).
Usefull for playing around with basic concepts like [Fourier features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10739.pdf) and network architecture.
